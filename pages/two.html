	<h2>February 22, 2020 - A Date Which Will Live in Infamy</h2>

	<p>
	In week 3 of the 2020 Overwatch League season, the Houston Outlaws and Boston Uprising met in Washington D.C to battle
	for the title of the worst team in the Overwatch League. Houston and Boston, 20th and 19th in the league respectively at the
	time, were both playing terrible Overwatch as of late and were ranked near the bottom of most analysts&rsquo; pre-season
	prediction rankings. Houston (0-2 as of Feb 22) didn&rsquo;t even win a single map in their first two matches against Florida
	and Washington. Blas&eacute;&rsquo;s McCree was showing to be one of the worst in the league, Muma was failing to hit any Earthshatters
	and dying constantly, and no synergy was being built because of the flex support musical chairs between Rawkus and Rapel.
	On the other side of the coin, Boston&rsquo;s (0-1 as of Feb 22) 2020 roster was filled with rookies (Jerry, Swimmer, Myunb0ng, Brussen) and
	was handed a tough loss in their first game against a veteran New York squad. Thus the Toilet Bowl was the battle of inexperience vs ineptitude, and it certainly delivered both.
	Play on both sides was sloppy, ineffective and downright insulting at times. Two teamfights can be seen as a microcosm of the entire series: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The first one (<a href="https://youtu.be/eOI-517tvkc?t=5075" class="timestamp">1:24:35</a>) is on Blizzard World, where Boston is 
		    trying to push the payload into point C. Everything is going well for the Uprising; Myunb0ng hits a sleep dart onto mek0
		    which sets them up to advance on Houston. However, they wait too long and mek0 wakes up, now able to use his Self Destruct.
		    He does, and Boston's Jerry simply falls down into the pit trying to avoid the D.Va bomb. With Boston's main damage dealer dead,
		    everything unravels for the Uprising, forcing them to reset. The indecisiveness of Boston led to a squandered opprotunity due to
		    Jerry's dreams of spelunking the caves of Blizzard World.</li>

		<li>The second fight (<a href="https://youtu.be/eOI-517tvkc?t=6747" class="timestamp">1:52:27</a>) is on Oasis, the first of three
		    &ldquo;tiebreaker&rdquo; Control rounds due to the two previous draws. Houston has a positional advantantage due to their control.
		    of the high ground and control of the objective, forcing Boston to advance on them.
		    The fight begins with Rawkus using his Nano-Boost on Jecse, who uses his heightened damage to take out Jerry. In retaliation, myunb0ong uses
		    his Nano on Axxiom, who is promptly slept by Rawkus. This would be the perfect time for Muma to pull off a fight-winning Earthshatter - especially since his 
		    Shatters this season have been less than effective - but he instead uses his charge on Axxiom and sends them all the way to the other side of the map.
		    However, Muma doesn&rsquo;t find a wall to pin Axxiom to, so he is free to charge Muma himself right after. Axxiom <i>does</i> get the wall pin and
		    kills Muma. You would think this would end up being a fight win for Boston, but Jecse was putting in <b>work</b> in the background, getting kills on
		    ColourHex, Mouffin, Jerry and myunb0ng (on L&uacute;cio of all heroes) to help Houson on their way to winning the fight, the round and the map after
		    one of the weirdest and most baffling teamfights in OWL history.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	Neither team truly wanted to win this game. There were two(!) draws in the match, with Boston leading 2-0 after four maps. At the beginning of the tiebreaker
	(un-drawable) Control maps, the Uprising looked like they had just given up. Houston won Oasis and Nepal, leading to an &ldquo;epic&rdquo; brawl in map 5 on Lijiang Tower.
	The two rounds were brawly and messy, but the Uprising were able to take both rounds and win the 2020 OWL Toilet Bowl. In the end, the Outlaws&rsquo; flex support musical chairs
	was their downfall; Rawkus was in for the first two tiebreakers, but they subbed him out for Rapel in map 7. Rawkus performed really well in maps five and six, but Rapel just couldn&rsquo;t
	match up with Swimmer on Lijiang, so Boston won the match and Houston won the bragging rights of being called the worst team in the Overwatch League.

	<h2>Toilet Bowl Fast Facts</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>In 2020, the league aveage map duration of Blizzard World is 14:23. The Outlaws and Uprising finished Blizzard World in a whopping 21:30.</li>
		<li>Conversely, the average map duration of Oasis is 11:45, while Boston and Houston finished the map in just 8:56.</li>
		<li>There were two draws in the Toilet Bowl (Temple of Anubis, Blizzard World), the only time this has ever happened in an Overwatch League match.</li>
		<li>Out of the six times Rawkus and Rapel could be subbed out for each other, the Outlaws did so five times. The Uprising made no substitutions.</li>
		<li>In the OWL, a &ldquo;Fleta Deadlift&rdquo; is when a player accounts for more than 50% of their team's final blows in a map win.
		    While the Uprising didn&rsquo;t win, Jerry had 18 of the team&rsquo;s 39 final blows (92.3% of a deadlift) in the Toilet Bowl&rsquo;s Blizzard World draw.</li>
		<ol type="i">
			<li>No matter if the Uprising win, lose, or draw a map, Jerry tries his very best to carry Boston to victory. There have been 15 times Jerry
			    has had more than 60% of a Fleta Deadlift in a map as of week 10, including five in the Toilet Bowl.</li>
