	<h2>Surpassing Expectations - Paris Eternal</h2>

	<p>
	The Paris Eternal (5-2) have given the entire Overwatch League a shock with their performance 
	through the first two months of play. After their lackluster 2019 campaign resulting in an 11-17 record,
	the Eternal retooled their roster and infused some Korean talent into their previously all-European lineup. 
	Of course the standout this season is Xzi, whose McCree has been easily one of
	the best in the league. He has sizeable leads in final blows per 10 minutes
	(12.1) and solo kills per 10 (2.8), as well as being behind only KSP (LAV) in eliminations per 10 (21.5) and
	damage per 10 (10,146) as the cowboy. However, it'd be a disservice to the rest of the 
	Eternal to not mention their fantastic play. Hanbin&rsquo;s D.Va has been fantastic, with high numbers
	in damage per 10 and final blows per 10 (6,738.9 and 7.4 respectively), combined with having great positioning to frequently negate 
	enemy Blizzards and shield attacks. FDGod&rsquo;s L&uacute;cio has been one
	of - if not THE most - aggressive L&uacute;cio in the league, leading all L&uacute;cios in final blows 
	per 10 (4.0) and being beaten only by Masaa (ATL) in solo kills per 10 (0.6). The best part is that all of this comes before
	spark1e, one of the hottest free agents of the offseason, has even hit the OWL age requirement, which
	means they can still go up from here. Their team play is so consistent and aggressive
	that they won against Carpe and the Philadelphia Fusion - arguably the strongest team in the league so far - in a greuling
	match that went a full five maps in week 5. The match included Paris&rsquo; attack on Junkertown, which set the record
	for the fastest Junkertown attack time in the history of OWL:

	<h2>The Biggest Letdown - Toronto Defiant</h2>

	<p>
	After a dismal 2019 season (with an 8-20 record), the Toronto Defiant (3-4) completely blew up their roster with RoKy, Logix and Mangachu
	being the only remaining players from last season. The Defiant then went on a free agent shopping spree, picking up players
	from the Los Angeles Valiant (Agilities, KariV), Los Angeles Gladiators (Surefour), Boston Uprising (Kellex), San Francisco
	Shock (Nevix) and Fusion University (Beast). With KariV earning a 2019 Role Star award and a team of strong North American
	and European players being added, many fans and analysts believed that Toronto would be a strong mid-field contender, with
	a worst-case scenario being a berth in the postseason play-in bracket. However, after a promising Opening Day win against Paris
	and a strong five-map showing against Philadelphia, the Defiant promptly fell flat against Atlanta, Houston and Florida. Their
	dive comp featuring Surefour&rsquo;s Sombra and Agilities&rsquo; Doomfist was promptly figured out by other teams, and Beast&rsquo;s
	Reinhardt play has been inconsistent at best after a strong first impression vs Paris. The situation seems bleak, and it seems like the players are
	playing as individuals rather than a whole team. However, there is solace in the fact that they scrapped out a strong win against Corey and
	the Washington Justice in week 9:
